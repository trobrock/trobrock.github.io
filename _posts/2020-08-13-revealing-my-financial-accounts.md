I've been wanting to talk about this for about a year now. This is going to be a bit more dense
than some of my other writing and will have an accompanying [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/trobrock)
video at some point. Let's get to it...

Near the early stages of my financial independence journey (which I am still on), I had a problem.
I was not able to put a large enough percentage of my income towards investments, and I didn't even
know how much I could afford or was currently putting towards it. I didn't really even know how much
total income I made and exactly where it went. This financial account structure was my solution to
this problem.

I sat down one day, pulled out my notebook, and began brainstorming an idea I had. This idea was
inspired by how I used to manage email when I was having to handle a large amount of it. The basic
building blocks of this model was that **all** my families income goes through a checking account
that I call the "Inbox". The idea of this account is that it's my holding account until I distribute
the funds to various other single-purpose accounts. I'll discuss my process for doing this further
down, but first let me cover my other accounts.

The rest of the accounts are divided into two categories. First, is the expenses category. I have
two accounts in this category (both checking accounts), one is for personal expenses and the other
is for my business expenses. I split these up this way so I can manage our family expenses as
controlled as possible in [YNAB](http://bit.ly/2EzlKgF) and manage my business expenses seperately
in [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/). The second category is investments. I've also broken this down
into two accounts. The first is my "storage" account for real estate investments (or any other
investments requiring larger chunks of cash). This account is a standard savings account (with Ally
Bank, because they are great and their rates are typically one of the highest). The other investment
account is my stock portfolio at [M1 Finance](https://bit.ly/39mzKHD).

By splitting my accounts into these categories I'm able to very explicitly control the percentage of
my income that goes to each. The idea is basically that I "pay myself" out of the inbox each month.
My target when implementing this was to be able to put away 40% of my income towards investments.
This is a little more complicated with any income that is not a monthly occurrence (think RSU's,
dividends, bonuses, etc.), so the target is an annual target.

I manage this whole this with one big spreadsheet (or trae-sheet as some would call it). This sheet
is basically my control panel for the flow of money through my accounts. When I have a change in
income I will update it on this sheet, when I do that it will automatically adjust how much I'm able
to put into investments based on my fixed-expense numbers for my expense categories.

On the first of each month I have a process that I go through to reconcile all my accounting software.
This process ensures everything is accurate and up-to-date (this is especially important in
[YNAB](http://bit.ly/2EzlKgF)). Once that is done, then I go down the list below and transfer money
from the Inbox to each of the accounts in the listed order, making the balance of the account match
the target balance specified. Once this is done, the money in the Inbox is not touched until next month.

It took quite a while to save enough money to be able to buffer money in my Inbox by a whole month,
but once I hit this tipping point the process has been AMAZING! I've moved from a target of 40%
invested to now being able to confidently invest 57% of my income.

I hope all this made sense and I'll attach the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/trobrock) video
to this as soon as I get it done.
