For about the last 6 months I’ve been trying to learn how to day trade in the futures market. I’ve had periods where I spend full days trading and times when I only trade for 30 minutes. I’ve yet to become profitable though.

One things I’ve done consistently is to keep a trading journal. The only issue is that this has limited effectiveness without being held accountable. For a while I was posting summaries in a private slack group I have with some friends, but there isn’t anyone else in there that understood the journey.

So, here I am starting that journal here. My intention is to review all of my trades, post graphs, analyze those graphs, and review my psychology for the day’s I trade on here.

If you have gone through this process or are going through it now, let me know in the comments. I hope this is helpful to you and me.

Here we go…
