I was having a problem, I would wake up take care of my son, go to work, come home, eat, and go to sleep, but I had so much more that I wanted to do. So, I asked myself the question of do I have time in my current schedule, and the answer was no. Ok, well that sucks, how do I get this stuff done then? My answer came in the form of a [Gary Vaynerchuk](https://medium.com/u/c4ec9163657c) YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edMfu5IILSI&index=3&list=PLo2c5GCfD-UFcJsmvtwvVOpIAgwMdpaY5). 18 hours, that’s what he said you had in a day. I took a step back at that point and really examined my schedule and realized I was just lying to myself.

My day wasn’t full, I just wasted a ton of time on crap like watching TV. I also slept more than I needed to. The steps I took to get to where I am:

1. Set my hours, I wanted to try 18 hours (I wasn’t sure if 6 hours of sleep was maintainable, but wanted to try it). Alright, 6am to midnight it is then.
2. Determine the things I could not drop from my current day. These things where spending time with my family and my daily work in the office.
3. Determine the things I wanted to add to my schedule. I added running, 4 hours of additional work time, and dedicated time to plan my day.
4. Then, I pieced all these things together and set the amount of time each needed. I started at the beginning of the day. I figured a run at the beginning of the day was the most likely for me to pull off given the schedules of my two boys, so I set that for 6am-7:30am (accounting for time to get out of bed and stretch and shower after, this leaves me with a good 45min to and hour of running). Great, now I needed to plan my day, that probably wouldn’t take more than 30 minutes. Then let’s look up the times for the train I take to work and put that in the calendar. I did that same for the train home, then added a block for family time. Family time was something I reduced during this process, I’m not willing to give up family time all together, but I could reduce it since I spend a lot on the weekends. Then I filled out the rest of the day with work time.
At this point I was a bit like:

![](/img/1*XzAt0Tpmvgvv0-_JqoousQ.jpeg)I thought, no way this is maintainable, but I follow a few people who do this all the time, so I tried it. I’ve now been following this schedule for 3 weeks and it is amazing.

A few key takeaways here, first, I do not think I could do this schedule without the morning run. I wake up feeling so tired and just want to sleep, but I get myself out of bed, run, and then I feel great and ready to go. Second, you **have** to be willing to sacrifice. I’m sacrificing family time, sleep, and “relaxing” time. For me, I’ve just realized that what I love doing is making progress on [my goals](https://medium.com/@trobrock/why-dont-i-have-a-dream-26d2b9a073ae) rather than binge watching TV.

I’m continuing to iterate on this process, but really haven’t seen anything I need to change right now. I hope this was helpful to someone who wants to do more in a day, but has convinced themselves they “don’t have time”.

If you are curious what my calendar looks like for this schedule, here it is:
