Let’s start today with my analysis of the instruments I’m watching. It looks like the ES made a new ATH (all-time-high), which is becoming an everyday thing at this point. GC (gold) is also sitting right between some supply and demand areas (1577–1568). What I’m going to be watching for is for ES to push back up to the ATH and grab a short entry at slightly above the ATH (probably around 3365). I’m also watching for a short entry on GC around 1577 (again).

I’m sitting here at 6:30 am right now, and nothing has moved towards any targets yet. It might be a no-trade day today.

Yep, no real movement this morning. Going to call it today. In my mind a day I don’t trade is a win, because in the past I would’ve forced it and lost money.
