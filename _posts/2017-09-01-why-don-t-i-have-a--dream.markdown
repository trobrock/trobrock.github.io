  So I’ve been contemplating about life a lot lately. Primarily, after consuming much of Gary Vaynerchuk’s content, I’ve led myself down a path of figuring out what my “dream” is.

Primarily, after consuming much of [Gary Vaynerchuk's](https://medium.com/u/c4ec9163657c) content, I’ve led myself down a path of figuring out what my “dream” is. I spent a lot of time making things up like “be my own boss”, “be rich”, or “never have to work again”. Most of these I found though weren’t me, they were regurgitations of “The American Dream”, or what I thought people would expect to hear.

Eventually I got past this blocker of thinking my dream was one of the above clichés. When I did that, I was back to square one… What the hell is my dream in life, what is that singular goal that when I hit it, I can say “that’s it, I succeeded”. For the life of me I couldn’t figure this out. Was there something wrong with me? Why don’t I have a “dream”?

Then it dawned on me, I don’t like the idea of having a goal that when I hit it I’m done. The idea of a “dream” implies an end state, and the simple idea of reaching the end does not appeal to me. I then took a different approach.

I stopped and thought “ok, that didn’t work, maybe let’s think about what I would be happy doing every day for the rest of my life”. I figured that would be easy, why wouldn’t I already know this? I started to think about what it was that I have immense talent in, and I would be happy doing forever. I could not come up with anything “real”, yet again I found myself stating things like “writing software” or “running a company”. All things that others would expect and all things that were way too specific and narrow for me to consider being happy doing that the rest of my life.

At this point I’m screwed right? That’s what I began thinking, maybe I’m just going aimlessly in the macro, while being clear in the micro. This sure isn’t where I want to be, so I thought what is a common theme of things I enjoy and continually do in life. The best I landed on was to generate more wealth. Now, being rich is not my goal, and generating wealth is not what I would love focusing on every day. So I thought, why do I do this at all. I could surely be perfectly happy with a cushy job and good cash flow, so why try and push it further?

Boom! It’s like it hit me in the face during a conversation with [Justin Gabriel](https://medium.com/u/4005295528c4). I love competing. I’ve always loved competing, growing up it was sports, or engineering, or whatever else I was doing. But, as I’ve progressed in life my “game” has become business. I want to win the un-winnable game of business. The very fact that it is un-winnable excites me, that means I will literally never run out of things to try to win. After this realization, I was able to piece it back to the wealth building. Wealth is the best measure, the best scoreboard for this game.

So, no, my goal isn’t to be rich, it isn’t to never have to work again. My “dream” is to never stop #hustling and constantly try and win the game of business. And just like that, I feel like I’ve figured out my path again. It feels good.
