title: Just a little break, sort of

I didn't trade yesterday. I just wasn't really feeling it, and I have a similar feeling today. I have a lot of projects going on right now, including a side-project I'm really excited about right now and my success hasn't been great in the markets.

I think I'm going to take a break from active day trading for the time being. I have a swing trading strategy that I've been wanting to try out, but I need to wait for 1) the setup to occur and 2) to have enough capital in my account to hold positions through the market close. So, what I think I'm going to do is to continue to fund my account and wait for that setup.

I'll still take some day trades if I am feeling it one day, but I think some time to step back a bit is going to help. I definitely feel like I keep trying the same losing strategy and I need a change.

Stay tuned. You may start seeing some blog posts related to other topics on here soon too.
